* Defects
** <2014-06-01 sun> Handling of abolute file names
Currently, all file names are assumed to be relative.
A prefix is added to each name, consising of the path
from the command line current dir, to the file name.

* New features
** Switches for turning on/off checking the existence of files
** Flatten file
Generate an input file that is equivalent to the given argument
(regarding output from running the program in normal mode, on it)
but that consists of a single "flat" file - a file that contains
no INCLUDE instructions.

This could be usefull for getting an overview of file references,
or for debugging.

A variant of this is to print only INCLUDE instructions, to get
an overview of all references.

** Associating tags with each file
Consists of two parts:
1. New instruction that produces no output:
   TAG <list of tags>
2. Switch to turn on output of tags

The first part sets a number of "tags" that will be associated with each file
up until a new TAG instruction.

In the output: each file will be preceded by the tags associated with it.

This feature could be usefull for combining information about different
categories of files using a single file list.
E.g. in which "phase" a file should be executed - "pre-install", "install",
"post-install".
Without this feature, categorizing files in this way requires a single
file list for each category.  And maintaining several files has some
drawbacks:
1. Difficulty to get an overview of all involved categories.
2. If a similair sub-directory structure is used for all categories,
   then this structure has to be repeated in each file
   (the INCLUDEs will be identical, except for concrete file-name).
