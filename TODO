* HOWTO implement a TODO
  1. Checkout new branch
  2. TDD impl functionality
     1. Setup new simptestcase test
     2. Add test to CMakeLists.txt
     3. Watch test fail
     4. Implement
     5. Refactor
  3. Write program help
  4. Remove item from this file.
* Improvements
** Customize the instruction token
   Make it possible to specify the prefix for instruction lines via a command
   line switch.
** Tags
*** sub-command: print-stack (for debugging)
*** Filter on tags
**** conditions
     The condition could be given by a single argument as a string.
     E.g. "all",  "any", "exactly", "not-all", "not-any", "not-exactly".
** List
*** match file-name using reg-ex
** Include
*** option to preserve "home directory" of that of the including file
    Usefull, e.g., for including a "standard list" that lists files that
    exist in many directories.
** Source-file info in PreprocessorException
Currently, no source-info is included in case of error of preprocessor.

It is a minor issue, since the preprocessor is independent of the file
argument (the input file is accessed via stdin).
But it would be nice to have the same trace as with other errors.
** File
*** Options for turning on/off checking the existence of files
*** Option for ignoring non-existing files
*** Strip ws at both ends of paths
*** Allow comments at end of line for lines with file
Reason it has not been done is,
1. lack of time
2. it could be useful to allow all form of names of files.
   Especially if file-existence is not check.  In that case,
   the comment character could be interpreted later down
   the pipe.
** Improve layout of pretty-printed tree
* Features
** stdin as FILE argument
File
** Flatten file
Generate an input file that is equivalent to the given argument
(regarding output from running the program in normal mode, on it)
but that consists of a single "flat" file - a file that contains
no INCLUDE instructions.

This could be usefull for getting an overview of file references,
or for debugging.

A variant of this is to print only INCLUDE instructions, to get
an overview of all references.

* Check current functionality
** Exporting of tags to following command line files
   Currently, I believe, tags are forwarded to later command line arguments.
   A consequence is that using a file as a single file argument may be
   different than using it as a second file argument.
   This may be good, since it is possible to "configure" later file by a
   first file.  But it may also be confusing.
   Perhaps it would be good with an option that makes it possible to both
   forward and not forward tags to later command line argument files.
* Build system
** Derive path of python3
** Support parallell builds
   Current, only one build is supported, since the file
   tests/common.m4.in
   is configured into
   tests/common.m4
   inside the source directory, and it contains a reference to the
   executable, which ideally should be put in the build directory.
