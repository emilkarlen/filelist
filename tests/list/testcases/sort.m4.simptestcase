# Tests sorting the files in a directory
#
# IMPORTANT: THIS IS A BAD TEST!!!
#
# The reason is that currently it is not possible to
# specify that the files in a directory should be read in
# an unsorted order.
#   This means that it is possible that the list files
# are sorted before the program should sort them.  If this is the case, this
# test will pass even though the program does not sort the list.
#
#   What this test garranties to test, though, is that the result will not
# become unsorted by using the sort-option!
#
# (Note: while developing this sort functionality, it was noted that
# readin the files of the test-dir did not give an already sorted result.)
