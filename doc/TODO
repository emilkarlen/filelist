* HOWTO implement a TODO
  1. Checkout new branch
  2. TDD impl functionality
     1. Setup new simptestcase test
     2. Add test to CMakeLists.txt
     3. Watch test fail
     4. Implement
     5. Refactor
  3. Write program help
  4. Remove item from this file.
* Tests
** testcase command-line-parsing-of-empty-set may be impl in python
   This test cannot be implemented (or is difficult to implement) in
   simptest.
   But it should be possible to implement it purely in Python, using Python's
   test framework.
** Sprid ut tester av taggar till de enskilda instruktionerna
   test-paketet tags ska föregå andra instruktioner o file-path.
* After v 1.0
** Read stdin lazily
** List
*** Improve match-expression
**** Support more file-types (today only f,d)
     May need to decide whether to follow sym-links or not - use stat or
     lstat.
**** Include/exclude condition on mode/perms
**** Complex expressions à la find
     Not, parenthasis, etc.
** Print inclusion-hierarchy
*** "Listen to" RenditionEnvironment: rendition of paths
- absolute paths
- normalise paths
Do this for non-pretty output.
** File
*** Option for including existence-info for each file-path
    Precede each line with "+ " for existing, and "- " for non-existing
    files, e.g.
*** filter: output all files, preceeded by info about filter-match
    Preceede each file with, e.g. "+ " for files that satisfy the filter
    condition, and "- " for files that don't.
    Useful when all files must be processed somehow, but processing differes
    depending on filter satisfaction.
** New instruction: find
** New instruction: file
   Syntax: @file PATH
   One more form for file-path.
   Same as file-path but the argument is split à la shell.
   This instruction makes it possible to use shell quoting to specify the
   path.
